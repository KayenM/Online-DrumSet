# ScotiaStudentDay-DrumSet

I created this drum set project to learn and grow my front-end development skills. I also loved playing around with garage band growing up, so this is a bit of a homage to that! I made it this project using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. 

Give it a shot and I hope you enjoy!
