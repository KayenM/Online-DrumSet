# Drum Set App

I created this drum set project to learn and grow my front-end development skills. I also loved playing around with garage band growing up, so this is a bit of a homage to that! 

Give it a shot and I hope you enjoy!

I made it this project using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. I developed it while interning at Scotiabank as a software engineer, when they gave all of their interns the day off for self-development! 

I made a LinkedIn post all about that, check it out: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kayen-mehta_scotiastudentday-scotiacampus-scotiastudentday-activity-6906684087390855168-QqGG?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web
